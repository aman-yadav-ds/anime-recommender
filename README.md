# üéå Anime Recommender System

A production-ready machine learning recommendation system that provides personalized anime recommendations using collaborative filtering and content-based approaches. Built with modern MLOps practices and deployed on Google Cloud Platform.  

### IMP Note 
- For Local development, We are following the below but for Production we will Deploy our Jenkins in a Google Cloud VM and set up all these step via the Jenkinsfile so the pipeline Runs Effectively. I deleted my VM for jenkins because I made this to showcase my tech stack and skills while using the free credits of GCP and I don't have enough money to keep that running. Also I deleted everything from the Google Cloud But I hosted the Docker Image in Hugging Face You can visit [Anime Recommender](https://huggingface.co/spaces/aman-yadav-ds/anime-recommender).

- **Google Artifact Registry**: Container image storage
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Data and model artifact storage

## üìä Data Flow Pipeline

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
```python
Raw Data Sources ‚Üí CSV Files / Google Cloud Streaming ‚Üí DVC Tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ anime.csv                 (anime metadata)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ animelist.csv             (user ratings)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ anime_with_synopsis.csv   (content features)
```
- **anime.csv** ‚Äî Metadata for each anime (title, type, episodes, rating, etc.)

- **anime_with_synopsis.csv** ‚Äî Extended metadata with anime descriptions/synopses (used for content-based features).

- **animelist.csv** ‚Äî Original dataset contains ~70M rows of user ratings.

Instead of loading it all into memory, I implemented selective ingestion via streaming from Google Cloud.

```python
with blob.open("r", encoding="utf-8") as gcs_file:
    data = pd.read_csv(
        gcs_file,
        nrows=5_000_000,
        low_memory=False
    )
```

For this project, only 5M rows were sampled for processing, drastically reducing load time and storage needs while keeping enough data for meaningful training.

### 2. **Data Processing**
- **Feature Engineering**: User-item interaction matrices
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers
- **Encoding**: User and anime ID encoding for neural networks
- **Train/Test Split**: Only used 1000 instance for validation

Because we are not using the model to predict and instead using the embeddings trained by the data we don't need to care much for validation, but it is good if our model behaves well in validation too so we use 1000 instances and my Early stopping callback is set to monitor 'val_loss' so it stops if our validation loss doesn't improve in 3 epochs.

```python
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(
    monitor='val_loss',
    patience=3,
    mode='min',
    restore_best_weights=True,
    verbose=1
)
```

### 3. **Model Training**
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implemented Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) architecture using user IDs and anime IDs as inputs.
- **Embedding Layers**: The model trains user embeddings and anime embeddings simultaneously.
- **Model Checkpointing**: Automatically saves the best performing weights during training based on validation loss.
```python
checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=CHECKPOINT_FILE_PATH,
    save_weights_only=True,
    monitor='val_loss',
    mode='min',
    save_best_only=True,
    verbose=0
)
```

#### Model Architecture

    A[User ID Input] --> B[User Embedding Layer]
    C[Anime ID Input] --> D[Anime Embedding Layer]
    B --> E[Dot Product/ Cosine Similarity]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Flatten]
    F --> G[Dense]
    G --> H[Batch Normalization]
    H --> I[Sigmoid Activation]
    I --> J[Output Prediction]
```

### 4. Model Serving

- **Embedding-Based Recommendations**  
  - After training, the model‚Äôs **user** and **anime** embedding layers are extracted and saved.  
  - Recommendations are generated by computing **similarity scores** (e.g., cosine similarity) between embeddings rather than running inference through the model.  

- **Prediction Pipeline**  
  - Uses **precomputed embeddings** for fast, real-time recommendation generation.  
  - No need to load the full trained model during serving.  

- **API Endpoints**  
  - Flask API to return recommendations for a given **user ID** or **anime ID** using a good frontend web page.

- **Caching**  
  - Frequently requested recommendations poster are cached to minimize repeated poster fetching using requests.
```python
poster_cache = {}

def fetch_anime_posters(mal_id):
    global poster_cache

    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
    image_url = data['data']['images']['jpg'].get('large_image_url') or \
                data['data']['images']['jpg'].get('image_url')

    poster_cache[mal_id] = image_url

    return image_url

```

**Serving Flow**:
```
User Based Recommendations                       Content based recommendations
    User ID                                               Anime ID

## üîß Jenkins Pipeline Optimization

### **Problem**: Initial Docker Image Size (10GB)
- **(Story)** ->
Initially i was doing everthing Whole ML pipeline and flask web app service inside my docker Image:
- ‚ùå 10GB+ Docker image size
- ‚ùå Slow deployment times
- ‚ùå High storage costs
- ‚ùå Poor scalability

### **Solution**: Optimized Pipeline Architecture
```yaml
Jenkins Pipeline Stages:
1. Github repo pull
2. Making a virtual environment
3. Dvc pull to see changes in raw directory and ML pipeline .py files using dvc repro with command to run pipeline if changes are detected.
    a. üì• Data Ingestion & Validation
    b. üîÑ Data Processing & Feature Engineering  
    c. üß† Model Training & Validation
    d. üì¶ Model Artifact Storage (GCS)
4. Lightweight Web App Docker Build
5. Deploy to GKE using configuration described in deployment.yaml file
```

### **Optimization Benefits**

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
- Python 3.11+
- Docker
- Google Cloud SDK
- kubectl
```

### **Local Development**

- Make sure you have uploaded the csvs from [Dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020") into a GCS bucket and have a sevice account made with (Storage Admin) and (Storage Object Viewer) roles. and then download the json file and set the env variable

```bash
gcloud auth login
#connect you google cloud account

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path to your json file without inverted commas.>
```
- Also update config.yaml in the config directory with
```yaml
data_ingestion:
  bucket_name: "Your_Bucket_Name"
  # Ensure you upload the csv and not the zip with these name or update the name here.
  bucket_file_names:
    - "anime.csv"
    - "anime_with_synopsis.csv"
    - "animelist.csv"
```

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/aman-yadav-ds/anime-recommender.git
cd anime-recommender

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .[development,deployment]

# Run ML pipeline
python pipeline/training_pipeline.py

# Start web application
python application.py
```

If you know how to use jenkins just host a local image of jenkins in you docker desktop and set up credentials and update the below with your credentials.

```jenkins
stage("Cloning from Github...."){
    steps{
        script{
            echo 'Cloning from Github...'
            checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/{Your branch in github}']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[credentialsId: '{your git hub token name}', url: '{Your git repository url}']])
        }
    }
}
```
Since this is too much work do -

### **Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t ImageName:Tag .

# Run container
docker run -p 10000:10000 ImageName:Tag
# Go to localhost:10000 in your browser
```

### **GCR Image Push**
```bash
gcloud config set project {Your Project Id}
gcloud auth configure-docker --quiet # Skips the confirmation with quiet
docker build -t gcr.io/{Your Project Id}/Image:tag .
docker push gcr.io/{Your Project Id}/Image:tag
```

### **GKE Deployment**
```bash
# Configure kubectl
gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME] --region asia-south2
# This region is for india

# Deploy to GKE
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
